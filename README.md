Assignment: PLTW 2.1.4 Date: 12/5/17 Team Members: Matthew Adrian, Adrian Liu, Harsha Jagarlamudi, Sean Tseng

Description: This assignment was a lesson in 2.1. We learned about variable scope. There are different types of scope such as class level scope and method level scope. Class level scope includes instance variables and static variables. Instance variables can be used anywhere within the class definition, so can static variables. Method level scope includes parameters and local variables. MVP designs have the presenter access the model and interact with views. MVC however, has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other.

Team Member Roles in Assignment: In this assignment, we all worked on the code together discussing how to do each step. Therefore, we all worked on the code simultaneously and not in different pasts. Also, the documentation was split up into quarters for each person.

Key Lessons Learned: In this lesson, we learned about a couple different things. The main points I believe are MVP vs. MVC, scope, and fragments. We learned the differences between MVP and MVC. Also, we learned different types of scope such as model level and class level scope and leraned about the components contained in each one. Fragments are important because it allows for modular design making it easier to port to tablets or other devices at later times.
